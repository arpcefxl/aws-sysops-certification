# Navigate to the Organizations console and select Policies on the left-hand nav
# Click on Service Control Policies, then Create Policy
# Either build a policy using the configurator, or you can paste deny_ec2_termination.json
# Organizations defaults to using an all-permissive SCP, so you can add a deny
# statement without breaking everything else, but make sure you have that permissive SCP
# in place first.

# After creating the policy, click on AWS Accounts on the left-hand nav, then locate the OU
# or account you want to attach, and click on it.
# In the Policies tab, you can then see what SCPs apply to the OU or account
# and you can add your newly created policy, then test an EC2 launch/terminate.
# The terminate will fail, and you'll have to detach the SCP to complete the task
