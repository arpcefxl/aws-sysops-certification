# If you don't have any endpoints in separate regions that you can use,
# execute the script ./generate_eips.sh, which will allocate one Elastic IP
# in each of two regions. The regions are specified as two command line options


# If you don't have an existing zone, execute ./generate_zone.sh with the command
# line option for the zone name. The zone will be private, and cannot be resolved
# from the Internet

# After allocating endpoints and creating the zone, Navigate to the Route 53 dashboard
# Select the newly created zone
# Click on "Create Record"
# Enter a record name
# Paste in one of the newly created EIPs in Value for A record type
# Change the Routing policy to Geolocation and select the location for the EIP
# For location, you can choose from continents, countries or US states

# Click on "Add Another Record", enter the SAME record name
# Paste in the second EIP, change the routing policy and select Default for location
# Click on "Create Records"
