# The attached cloudformation template will create a policy that can be
# attached to a single IAM user for their unique S3 read/write permissions
# The intent would be to create one template (or object) for each IAM user
# The IAM policy is attached INLINE to the user, which is one way of achieving least privilege
# by assigning unique permissions to each user with exactly the permissions they need

# Replace the "s3test" below with the username you're planning to modify
# so that the stack is clearly labeled
# Also note that stack names cannot have underscores
