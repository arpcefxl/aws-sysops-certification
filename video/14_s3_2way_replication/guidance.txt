# First, edit the s3 creation script and populate the variables
# Then, execute the S3 creation script to create buckets and generate test data

# Navigate to the S3 console, and select the first bucket
# Click on the Management tab, scroll down and select "Create Replication Rule"
# Configure replication to bucket2
# Then follow the same procedure on bucket2, configuring replication to bucket1

# To test the replication, upload different files to bucket1 and bucket2
# Wait for up to 15 minutes, then check each bucket to ensure replication was successful
# Note that the original files uploaded to each bucket will NOT replicate
# It is left as an exercise to manually sync the object content to the other bucket
