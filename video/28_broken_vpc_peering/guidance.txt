# install Terraform on Amazon Linux 2 for deploying the infrastructure
./terraform-install-amazonlinux2.sh

# After the infrastructure is deployed in us-west-2, fix all the broken
# configuration until you can log into one EC2 instance and ping the other
# Hint: you'll need to update the keypair for sure
# Happy troubleshooting!
